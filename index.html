<h3><strong>Great Wall of China</strong></h3>
<p>Holding the title of “longest human-made structure in the world,” the Great Wall is actually many walls running through northern China and southern Mongolia.

    One significant stretch is particularly well preserved and is the part that most of us visit today. The section running from Mount Hu in Liaoning province to Jiayu Pass in Gansu province is 5,500 miles long, up to 21 feet wide, and nearly 33 feet tall at its highest point.
    
    The Great Wall is known for its fascinating history as much as for its remarkable engineering. It connected fortifications across the regions to create a more impenetrable defense against would-be invaders. While some sections were built of stone, others used existing ditches, moats, and irrigation systems. Some parts of the wall aren’t a wall at all but rather natural barriers like mountain ridges.
    
    One of the best parts of the Great Wall to visit is in Mutianyu, only about 90 minutes by car from Beijing. It isn’t the most visited section, but that’s not a bad thing since it means you likely won’t be overrun by other tourists. The paths are restored and relatively flat.</p>

<h3><strong>Christ the Redeemer Statue</strong></h3>
<p>When you go to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, look up. Standing 2,300 feet above the city at the peak of Mount Corcovado, is the hard-to-miss Christ the Redeemer statue. Its size also makes it quite eye-catching. It’s 98 feet tall from head to toe (add another 26 feet for the pedestal) and 92 feet wide from fingertip to fingertip of the sculpture’s outstretched hands.

    One of the most popular ways to see the Christ the Redeemer is by train. A short ride takes you through an urban rainforest before dropping you off at the statue for a tour. Alternatively, you can hike to the top. There have been reports of increasing petty theft, so don’t hike alone and do leave any valuables (including your phone) at your hotel.
    
    Because it is one of the Wonders of the World, crowds can get large. Avoid the worst of them by visiting early in the morning. If lots of people don’t bother you, though, go in the early evening and catch the incredible sunset over the city.</p>

<h3><strong>Machu Picchu</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes called the Lost City of the Incas, Machu Picchu is thought to have been a royal retreat for the Incas in the 15th century before it was mysteriously abandoned. Because it’s nestled in the Andes Mountains between two peaks, Machu Picchu went largely unnoticed by European and American explorers for about 400 years.

    Since its rediscovery, Machu Picchu has brought millions of tourists from all over the world to Peru. The Sun Gate and Temple of the Sun serve as relics of one of the world’s first great civilizations.
    
    You can arrive on foot, like its original inhabitants would have done, by taking any of the multi-day treks. Or take a more leisurely route via the train. Either way, you’ll be treated to jungle views that only build anticipation of your arrival at Machu Picchu.
    
    Much is still unknown about the site, but that adds to the allure of this incredible wonder. You’ll love exploring what remains of the ruins and imagining what might have been.</p>

<h3><strong>Chichén Itzá</strong></h3>
<p>Located in the jungles of Mexico, toward the tip of the Yucatan Peninsula, is the abandoned ancient city of Chichén Itzá. More than two million people visit the archeological site annually to get a glimpse into the art, architecture, and science of the Mayan culture.

    When we think of Chichén Itzá, most of us picture the site’s tiered pyramid, El Castillo, which served as a temple to the deity Kukulcán. Equally fascinating to explore, though, are the Temple of the Warriors, the Observatory (remember how important astronomy is to the Maya?), and dozens of other ruins.
    
    Also on site is the Sacred Cenote, one of the reasons Chichén Itzá got its name, meaning “Where Wise Men of the Water Live.” Freshwater cenotes remain a draw in the region for travelers seeking healing, rest, and rejuvenation.</p>

<h3><strong>Roman Colosseum</strong></h3>
<p>One of Italy’s most well-known relics, the Colosseum was once the height of entertainment for its famed gladiator contests. It seated 50,000 spectators — more than twice the capacity of New York’s Madison Square Garden — which is only one small reason it’s such an architectural marvel.

    The Colosseum was one of the few freestanding amphitheaters of its time in the 1st century; most were built into hillsides for support. This design choice led to the vaults and columns that give the Colosseum its iconic appearance.
    
    There are several ways to see the Colosseum. Depending on how in depth you want your visit to be, you can explore on your own or book a tour. You’ll need a guide for the underground levels, and reservations to see the Attic on the upper levels. There’s also The Museo del Colosseo on the second level.
    
    In short, plan your visit beforehand and give yourself plenty of time to see it all.</p>

<h3><strong>Taj Mahal</strong></h3>
<p>Built nearly 400 years ago as a statement of love, the Taj Mahal is thought to be the height of Indian Mogul architecture. It’s easily India’s most recognizable building, palace or otherwise.

    The Taj Mahal features a white marble exterior and an interior mausoleum with the tombs of its designers underneath. Throughout the complex are pietra dura — stone with inlays of jade, crystal, amethyst, and other semiprecious gems — and Arabic calligraphy.
    
    The mausoleum isn’t the only structure in the complex, though. Visiting the other sites might not be as popular, but that means they’ll also be less crowded.
    
    And the Taj Mahal can get super busy with other tourists. Start your tour early in the morning for the most unbothered visit or for the best chance of taking photos not filled with strangers.
    
    Other pro tips for visiting the Taj Mahal include hiring a legitimate tour guide rather than someone hawking their services on the street, and dressing modestly. Although there is no dress code, the Taj Mahal is a working mosque. Covering your shoulders and not wearing short skirts or shorts is an appreciated sign of respect.
    
    Despite its beauty, the Taj Mahal has suffered years of decay. This is largely due to environmental pollution. Although efforts are ongoing to reduce the impact of that pollution, it is slow progress.</p>

<h3><strong>Petra</strong></h3>
<p>Also known as the Rose City for the red rock it’s built from, this ancient Jordanian city was once part of a major trade route. Going by its Greek name meaning “Rock,” Petra is considered one of the most beautiful places in the world and was even referenced in the Bible by the name Sela.

    It has been inhabited, invaded, and abandoned countless times over the centuries, and it wasn’t really until the 1950s that the rest of the world took notice of this wonder. Excavations during that time uncovered tombs, temples, monuments, and the High Place of Sacrifice, an altar from biblical times.
    
    The most popular spot today is the Treasury, or Al Khazneh. You’ll likely recognize the facade with Greek-style pillars carved directly into the rock wall from pictures and movies.
    
    The exterior of the Treasury is illuminated by candlelight on certain nights, so you might decide to time your visit to catch this view. Just be prepared to pay for an extra ticket to see it.
    
    To get the most bang for your buck, it actually makes more sense to buy a multi-day ticket. Adding an extra day or two to your itinerary adds just a tiny amount to the cost of a single-day entry. Plus, with so much to explore, it will be worth the extra time and expense.</p>
